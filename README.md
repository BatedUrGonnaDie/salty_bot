Somewhat basic twitch chat bot with Twitch API and soon LoL API integration.

Python module "requests" is required for this script due to the core integration.

Aim of this bot is to be able to retrieve game playing for speedrunners to have rotating commands for different games.

If you do not like a command that I had added simply remove the `if` block for it and any variables that are exclusive to that block (i.e. to, bo, u, dash)
